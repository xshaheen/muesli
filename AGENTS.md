# AGENTS.md

## Cloud Agents (Linux)

Muesli is a native macOS app. Cloud Agents run on Linux and cannot build the Swift app, run `swift test`, or exercise `muesli-cli` without a macOS host.

Use the Linux CI checks that mirror `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on `ubuntu-latest`:

```bash
./scripts/test_classify_changed_files.sh
./scripts/test_ci_test_shards.sh
./scripts/verify_update_flow.sh --skip-dmg
```

Native builds and the full test suite require macOS 14.2+ with Xcode 16+:

```bash
./scripts/dev-test.sh
swift test --package-path native/MuesliNative
```

## Build Artifacts and Worktrees

SwiftPM can write build artifacts to `native/MuesliNative/.build` inside the active worktree. That can consume several GB per worktree when multiple feature worktrees are used.

Local build scripts resolve a shared SwiftPM scratch path through `scripts/muesli_spm_cache.sh`:

- If `MUESLI_SWIFTPM_SCRATCH_PATH` is set, that explicit path wins.
- If `MUESLI_SWIFTPM_SCRATCH_CHANNEL` is set, scripts use that channel under the resolved cache root.
- If `MUESLI_EXTERNAL_SPM_CACHE_ROOT` is set, it replaces the default `/Volumes/MuesliBuildCache/muesli-spm` external cache root.
- Otherwise, if `/Volumes/MuesliBuildCache/muesli-spm` is mounted, scripts use that external APFS cache.
- Otherwise, scripts fall back to `$HOME/Library/Caches/muesli-spm`.
- Set `MUESLI_DISABLE_SWIFTPM_SCRATCH_PATH=1` to intentionally use SwiftPM's package-local `.build`; this takes precedence over all scratch path settings.

The external cache lives in an APFS sparse bundle at `/Volumes/eSSD/MuesliBuildCache.sparsebundle`; attach it before build-heavy work:

```bash
hdiutil attach /Volumes/eSSD/MuesliBuildCache.sparsebundle
```

`/Volumes/eSSD/MuesliBuildCache.sparsebundle` is the maintainer's local SSD path. Contributors can substitute their own volume path or skip the attach step; scripts fall back to `~/Library/Caches/muesli-spm` when the external cache is not mounted.

Default channels:

```bash
./scripts/dev-test.sh                 # /Volumes/MuesliBuildCache/muesli-spm/worktrees/<worktree>/dev when mounted
./scripts/build_native_app.sh release # /Volumes/MuesliBuildCache/muesli-spm/release when mounted
./scripts/release-preprod.sh          # /Volumes/MuesliBuildCache/muesli-spm/preprod when mounted
```

For direct or concurrent worktree builds, pass a specific path:

```bash
MUESLI_SWIFTPM_SCRATCH_PATH="/Volumes/MuesliBuildCache/muesli-spm/worktrees/pr182/dev" ./scripts/dev-test.sh
swift test --package-path native/MuesliNative --scratch-path "/Volumes/MuesliBuildCache/muesli-spm/worktrees/pr182/test"
```

Caveat: do not run concurrent builds from different worktrees into the same scratch path. Use separate paths per channel, agent, or simultaneous build, such as `worktrees/pr182/dev`, `worktrees/pr188/dev`, or `agent-1`.

## Parallel Dev Lanes

Use fixed lanes when testing multiple worktrees side by side:

```bash
./scripts/dev-test.sh --lane A
./scripts/dev-test.sh --lane B
./scripts/dev-test.sh --lane C
```

Named lanes install as `/Applications/MuesliDevA.app`, `/Applications/MuesliDevB.app`, and `/Applications/MuesliDevC.app`, with matching bundle IDs `com.muesli.dev.a`, `com.muesli.dev.b`, and `com.muesli.dev.c`. Each lane has its own support directory under `~/Library/Application Support/`.

Named lanes default to local-only signing, which omits iCloud and APNs entitlements for feature work that does not test sync or push behavior. Use `--cloud-entitlements` only for lanes that have matching Apple Developer profiles and need iCloud/APNs behavior.

Deleting a scratch path only removes rebuildable SwiftPM artifacts. It does not delete installed app bundles or app data under `~/Library/Application Support/`.

For direct SwiftPM test runs, pass the scratch path yourself:

```bash
swift test --package-path native/MuesliNative --scratch-path "/Volumes/MuesliBuildCache/muesli-spm/test"
```

## Learnings

- Meeting chat history is stored locally in `meetings.chat_history_json`, uses the active `AppIdentity.supportDirectoryName`, and is intentionally excluded from CloudKit sync. (2026-08-09)
- `MeetingSelectableText.sizeThatFits` must honor the native text field's fitting height; attributed-string bounds can be one point shorter and clip the final transcript line. (2026-08-13)
